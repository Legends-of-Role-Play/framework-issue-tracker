## framework
The op-framework project has in goal to provide a fully functional FiveM roleplay server (made from scratch) with advanced and highly developed features.

All development is done by Silo1911 and Zombiecide. No development will be rushed, making sure it is done properly and thoroughly. I expect to push regular updates introducing new features, bug-fixes, and balancing changes.

OP-FW is written in Lua, but HTML, CSS & JavaScript is also used a lot for the UIs.

## issues
